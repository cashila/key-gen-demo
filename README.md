# Caveats

- Ether, when address is hashed, sha3 is used, but this is not standard version, but the one used in proposal (afaik same params differ)
- For ethereum it would be best, if Mist compatible wallet would be generated because it would be easiest to use, not sure what to do about password with which wallet should be encrypted
- For Lisk, it would be best if device generated seed, because this is used primary lisk wallet software
